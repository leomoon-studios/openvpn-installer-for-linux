# OpenVPN Installer for Linux
## Introduction
Having your own OpenVPN service is very important these days but setting one up can be very tedious!

This script will setup a secure OpenVPN server on Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Fedora and Arch Linux at home or on a VPS.

It is recommended to use the default encryption settings and only change port, protocol, DNS resolver and domain settings.

## Features
*   Installs and configures a secure OpenVPN server on
*   Automatic setup of firewall rules using iptables
*   Has many customization options
*   Ability to define a FQDN with OpenVPN
*   Includes silent and CLI install
*   Includes silent and CLI management (&ldquo;sudo lmovpn&rdquo;):
    *   Add a new client
    *   List active clients
    *   Revoke existing client
    *   Debug OpenVPN using journalctl
    *   Restart OpenVPN service
    *   Uninstall OpenVPN

## Usage
Download it using ```curl``` and make it executable:
```
curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leomoon-studios/openvpn-installer/master/src/openvpn-installer -O ~/openvpn-installer
chmod +x ~/openvpn-installer
```
OR download it using ```wget``` and make it executable:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leomoon-studios/openvpn-installer/master/src/openvpn-installer -O ~/openvpn-installer
chmod +x ~/openvpn-installer
```
Run it and follow the onscreen instructions:
```
cd ~/ && sudo ./openvpn-installer
```
After installation is done, use &ldquo;sudo lmovpn&rdquo; to add new clients and manage your OpenVPN server.

## Silent Install
You can also run this script silently with default options. The silent option will use the best encryption settings.
```
SILENT=y sudo -E ./openvpn-installer
```
Silent install will use the options below:
*	Port 1194
*	UDP protocol
*	Google DNS resolver
*	no compression
*	AES-256-GCM cipher for data channel
*	ECDSA certificate with prime256v1 curve
*	TLS-ECDHE-ECDSA-WITH-AES-128-GCM-SHA256 cipher for control channel
*	ECDH for Diffie-Hellman key with prime256v1 curve
*	SHA-256 for digest algorithm
*	tls-crypt for additional security

Here are some examples if you want to install silently with custom options:
```
#change PORT to 2432 and PROTOCOL to tcp
SILENT=y PORT=2432 PROTOCOL=tcp sudo -E ./openvpn-installer

#change PORT to 23423, PROTOCOL to tcp and DNS_TYPE to Cloudflare
SILENT=y PORT=23423 DNS_TYPE=2 sudo -E ./openvpn-installer

#change DATACIPHER_TYPE to AES-256-CBC and CERT_TYPE to RSA
#since RSA_TYPE and CONTROLCIPHER_TYPE are not defined,
#default 2048 bits will be used for RSA_TYPE
#and TLS-ECDHE-RSA-WITH-AES-128-GCM-SHA256 will be used for CONTROLCIPHER_TYPE
SILENT=y DATACIPHER_TYPE=4 CERT_TYPE=2 sudo -E ./openvpn-installer
```

## Silent Management
You can also perform management options silently while using lmovpn. Here are some examples:

```
#add a new client
MENU=1 CLIENT=amin PASS=n sudo -E lmovpn

#add multiple clients
USERS=(desktop laptop mobile)
for i in ${USERS[@]};do
   MENU=1 CLIENT=$i PASS=n sudo -E lmovpn
done

#restart OpenVPN server
MENU=5 sudo -E lmovpn
```
